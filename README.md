# Nifty 50 Stock Price Analysis

**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and predict stock prices for companies listed in the Nifty 50 index. We will utilize historical stock price data, implement various data analysis techniques, and build predictive models to gain insights into market trends and potential future movements.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical stock data for Nifty 50 companies, encompassing features such as:

* Date
* Open price
* High price
* Low price
* Close price
* Volume

**Data Analysis and Visualization**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the distribution of stock prices.
   - Identify trends and seasonality patterns.
   - Analyze the correlation between different stock prices.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features like moving averages, momentum, and volatility.
   - Normalize or standardize features to improve model performance.

3. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Decompose time series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Apply time series forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet.

**Predictive Modeling**

1. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Train and evaluate various machine learning models, including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regression
     - Support Vector Regression
     - XGBoost Regression

2. **Deep Learning Models:**
   - Implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence-based predictions.

**Evaluation Metrics**

To assess the performance of our models, we will use metrics such as:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* R-squared (RÂ²)

**Visualization**

We will utilize libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations, including:

* Line plots for time series data
* Histograms and box plots for data distribution
* Scatter plots for correlation analysis
* Heatmaps for feature importance

**Future Work**

* Incorporate additional features like news sentiment analysis and economic indicators.
* Experiment with advanced techniques like ensemble methods and transfer learning.
* Develop a web application to visualize and interact with the results.

By following these steps and leveraging the power of data science, we can gain valuable insights into the stock market and make informed investment decisions.
